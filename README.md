# Building a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier

The purpose of this project is to engineer a k-NN classification pipeline from scratch, without using any machine learning libraries.

n-fold nested cross-validation is used to find the address overfitting and provide detection of the best hyperparameters.
